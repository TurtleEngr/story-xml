# story-xml

story-xml is an xml based tool for authors writing fiction.  It
supports structured writing and formatting from beginning to end.

If you like to write, and would like a professional layout, but you
don't want to be bothered with the formatting work, then this tool is
for you.

If you like fiddling with the layout, paging, and formatting, with
WYSIWYG tools, then this tool is NOT for you; there are many other
excellent tools, such as LibreOffice, that will meet your needs.

story-xml is more of a "batch" processing tool.  It helps you organize
your story, keep track of the timeline, plot treads, scene/sequel
structure, scene locations, back story, etc.  Your notes are defined
inline with the text that is actually printed.  You can mark sections
with a revision status: in-progress, draft, or final.  You control
what threads, units, and revision levels print.

The manuals can be found in src/doc/
