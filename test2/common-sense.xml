<p><i>introduction</i></p>

<p>Perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not
<i>yet</i> sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favour; a
long habit of not thinking a thing <i>wrong</i>, gives it a
superficial appearance of being <i>right</i>, and raises at first a
formidable outcry in defense of custom.  But the tumult soon subsides.
Time makes more converts than reason.</p>

<p>As a long and violent abuse of power, is generally the Means of
calling the right of it in question (and in Matters too which might
never have been thought of, had not the Sufferers been aggravated into
the inquiry) and as the King of England hath undertaken in his
<i>own</i> right, to support the Parliament in what he calls theirs,
and as the good people of this country are grievously oppressed by the
combination, they have an undoubted privilege to inquire into the
pretensions of both, and equally to reject the usurpation of
either.</p>

<p>In the following sheets, the author hath studiously avoided every
thing which is personal among ourselves.  Compliments as well as
censure to individuals make no part thereof.  The wise, and the worthy,
need not the triumph of a pamphlet; and those whose sentiments
are injudicious, or unfriendly, will cease of themselves unless
too much pains are bestowed upon their conversion.</p>

<p>The cause of America is in a great measure the cause of all mankind.
Many circumstances hath, and will arise, which are not local, but universal,
and through which the principles of all Lovers of Mankind are affected,
and in the Event of which, their Affections are interested.
The laying a Country desolate with Fire and Sword, declaring War
against the natural rights of all Mankind, and extirpating
the Defenders thereof from the Face of the Earth, is the Concern
of every Man to whom Nature hath given the Power of feeling;
of which Class, regardless of Party Censure, is the <i>author</i>.</p>

<p>P.S.  The Publication of this new Edition hath been delayed,
with a View of taking notice (had it been necessary)
of any Attempt to refute the Doctrine of Independance:
As no Answer hath yet appeared, it is now presumed that none will,
the Time needful for getting such a Performance ready for the Public
being considerably past.</p>

<p>Who the Author of this Production is, is wholly unnecessary to the Public,
as the Object for Attention is the <i>doctrine</i> itself, not the man.  Yet it may
not be unnecessary to say, That he is unconnected with any Party, and under no
sort of Influence public or private, but the influence of reason and principle.</p>

<p>Active: (<i>With</i> concise remarks on the english constitution.)</p>

<p>Some writers have so confounded society with government,
as to leave little or no distinction between them;
whereas they are not only different, but have different origins.
Society is produced by our wants, and government by our wickedness;
the former promotes our <i>positively</i> by uniting our affections,
the latter <i>negatively</i> by restraining our vices.  The one
encourages intercourse, the other creates distinctions.
The first a patron, the last a punisher.</p>

<p>Society in every state is a blessing, but government even in its best
state is but a necessary evil; in its worst state an intolerable one;
for when we suffer, or are exposed to the same miseries <i>by</i> A government,
which we might expect in a country <i>without</i> government, our calamity
is heightened by reflecting that we furnish the means by which we suffer.
Government, like dress, is the badge of lost innocence; the palaces of kings
are built on the ruins of the bowers of paradise.  For were the impulses
of conscience clear, uniform, and irresistibly obeyed, man would need
no other lawgiver; but that not being the case, he finds it necessary
to surrender up a part of his property to furnish means for the protection
of the rest; and this he is induced to do by the same prudence which in every
other case advises him out of two evils to choose the least.  <i>wherefore</i>,
security being the true design and end of government, it unanswerably follows,
that whatever <i>form</i> thereof appears most likely to ensure it to us,
with the least expense and greatest benefit, is preferable to all others.</p>
</text>

<thread ref="tom" next-unit="2">
<text type="indent" active="yes">
<p>In order to gain a clear and just idea of the design and end of
government, let us suppose a small number of persons settled in some
sequestered part of the earth, unconnected with the rest, they will
then represent the first peopling of any country, or of the world.
In this state of natural liberty, society will be their first thought.
A thousand motives will excite them thereto, the strength of one man
is so unequal to his wants, and his mind so unfitted for perpetual
solitude, that he is soon obliged to seek assistance and relief of
another, who in his turn requires the same.  Four or five united would
be able to raise a tolerable dwelling in the midst of a wilderness,
but one man might labour out of the common period of life without
accomplishing any thing; when he had felled his timber he could not
remove it, nor erect it after it was removed; hunger in the mean time
would urge him from his work, and every different want call him
a different way.  Disease, nay even misfortune would be death,
for though neither might be mortal, yet either would disable him
from living, and reduce him to a state in which he might
rather be said to perish than to die.</p>

<p>Thus necessity, like a gravitating power, would soon form our newly
arrived emigrants into society, the reciprocal blessings of which,
would supersede, and render the obligations of law and government
unnecessary while they remained perfectly just to each other;
but as nothing but heaven is impregnable to vice, it will
unavoidably happen, that in proportion as they surmount the first
difficulties of emigration, which bound them together in a common cause,
they will begin to relax in their duty and attachment to each other;

some form of government to supply the defect of moral virtue.</p>

<p>Some convenient tree will afford them a State-House, under the
branches of which, the whole colony may assemble to deliberate on
public matters.  It is more than probable that their first laws will
have the title only of <i>regulations</i>, and be enforced by no other

<p>But as the colony increases, the public concerns will increase
likewise, and the distance at which the members may be separated,
will render it too inconvenient for all of them to meet on
every occasion as at first, when their number was small,
their habitations near, and the public concerns few and trifling.
This will point out the convenience of their consenting to leave
the legislative part to be managed by a select number chosen
from the whole body, who are supposed to have the same concerns
at stake which those who appointed them, and who will act in the
same manner as the whole body would act, were they present.
If the colony continues increasing, it will become necessary
to augment the number of the representatives, and that the interest
of every part of the colony may be attended to, it will be found
best to divide the whole into convenient parts, each part sending
its proper number; and that the <i>elected</i> might never form to themselves
an interest separate from the <i>electors</i>, prudence will point out
the propriety of having elections often; because as the <i>elected</i>
might by that means return and mix again with the general body
of the <i>electors</i> in a few months, their fidelity to the public
will be secured by the prudent reflection of not making a rod
for themselves.  And as this frequent interchange will establish
a common interest with every part of the community, they will
mutually and naturally support each other, and on this (not on
the unmeaning name of king) depends the <i>strength</i> of government,
<i>and</i> the happiness of the governed.</p>

<p>Here then is the origin and rise of government; namely, a mode rendered
necessary by the inability of moral virtue to govern the world;
here too is the design and end of government, viz.  freedom and security.
And however our eyes may be dazzled with show, or our ears deceived by sound;
however prejudice may warp our wills, or interest darken our understanding,
the simple voice of nature and of reason will say, it is right.</p>

<p>I draw my idea of the form of government from a principle in
nature, which no art can overturn, viz.  that the more simple any
thing is, the less liable it is to be disordered; and the easier
repaired when disordered; and with this maxim in view, I offer a few
remarks on the so much boasted constitution of England.  That it was
noble for the dark and slavish times in which it was erected, is
granted.  When the world was overrun with tyranny the least remove
therefrom was a glorious rescue.  But that it is imperfect, subject to
convulsions, and incapable of producing what it seems to promise, is
easily demonstrated.</p>

</chapter>

<!-- *******************************

<p>Absolute governments (tho' the disgrace of human nature) have this
advantage with them, that they are simple; if the people suffer,
they know the head from which their suffering springs, know likewise
the remedy, and are not bewildered by a variety of causes and cures.
But the constitution of England is so exceedingly complex,
that the nation may suffer for years together without being able to discover
in which part the fault lies; some will say in one and some in another,
and every political physician will advise a different medicine.</p>

<p>I know it is difficult to get over local or long standing prejudices,
yet if we will suffer ourselves to examine the component parts of the
English constitution, we shall find them to be the base remains of two
ancient tyrannies, compounded with some new republican materials.</p>

<p><i>first</i> - The remains of monarchial tyranny in the person of the king.
<i>secondly</i> - The remains of aristocratical tyranny in the persons of the peers.
<i>thirdly</i> - The new republican materials in the persons of the commons,
          on whose virtue depends the freedom of England.</p>

<p>The two first, by being hereditary, are independent of the people;
wherefore in a <i>constitutional</i> sense they contribute nothing towards
the freedom of the state.</p>

<p>To say that the constitution of England is a <i>union</i> of three powers
reciprocally <i>checking</i> each other, is farcical, either the words have
no meaning, or they are flat contradictions.</p>

<p>To say that the commons is a check upon the king, presupposes two things:</p>

<p><i>first</i> - That the king is not to be trusted without being looked after,
or in other words, that a thirst for absolute power is the natural
disease of monarchy.</p>

<p><i>secondly</i> - That the commons, by being appointed for that purpose,
are either wiser or more worthy of confidence than the crown.</p>

<p>But as the same constitution which gives the commons a power to check
the king by withholding the supplies, gives afterwards the king a power
to check the commons, by empowering him to reject their other bills;
it again supposes that the king is wiser than those whom it has already
supposed to be wiser than him.  A mere absurdity!</p>

<p>There is something exceedingly ridiculous in the composition of monarchy;
it first excludes a man from the means of information, yet empowers him
to act in cases where the highest judgment is required.  The state of a king
shuts him from the world, yet the business of a king requires him to know
it thoroughly; wherefore the different parts, by unnaturally opposing
and destroying each other, prove the whole character to be absurd and useless.</p>

<p>Some writers have explained the English constitution thus: The king,
say they, is one, the people another; the peers are a house in behalf
of the king, the commons in behalf of the people; but this hath all
the distinctions of a house divided against itself; and though
the expressions be pleasantly arranged, yet when examined,
they appear idle and ambiguous; and it will always happen,
that the nicest construction that words are capable of,
when applied to the description of some thing which either
cannot exist, or is too incomprehensible to be within
the compass of description, will be words of sound only,
and though they may amuse the ear, they cannot inform the mind,
for this explanation includes a previous question, viz.
<i>how</i> came the king by A power which the people are afraid to trust,
<i>and</i> always obliged to check?  Such a power could not be the gift
of a wise people, neither can any power, <i>which</i> needs checking,
be from God; yet the provision, which the constitution makes,
supposes such a power to exist.</p>

<p>But the provision is unequal to the task; the means either cannot
or will not accomplish the end, and the whole affair is a felo de se;
for as the greater weight will always carry up the less, and as all
the wheels of a machine are put in motion by one, it only remains to know
which power in the constitution has the most weight, for that will govern;
and though the others, or a part of them, may clog, or, as the phrase is,
check the rapidity of its motion, yet so long as they cannot stop it,
their endeavours will be ineffectual; the first moving power will
at last have its way, and what it wants in speed, is supplied by time.</p>

<p>That the crown is this overbearing part in the English constitution,
needs not be mentioned, and that it derives its whole consequence
merely from being the giver of places and pensions, is self-evident,
wherefore, though we have been wise enough to shut and lock a door
against absolute monarchy, we at the same time have been foolish
enough to put the crown in possession of the key.</p>

<p>The prejudice of Englishmen in favour of their own government by king,
lords, and commons, arises as much or more from national pride than reason.
Individuals are undoubtedly safer in England than in some other countries,
but the <i>will</i> of the king is as much the law of the land in Britain
as in France, with this difference, that instead of proceeding directly
from his mouth, it is handed to the people under the more formidable shape
of an act of parliament.  For the fate of Charles the First hath only made
kings more subtle - not more just.</p>

<p>Wherefore, laying aside all national pride and prejudice
in favour of modes and forms, the plain truth is, that
<i>it</i> is wholly owing to the constitution of the people,
<i>and</i> not to the constitution of the government,
that the crown is not as oppressive in England as in Turkey.</p>

<p>An inquiry into the <i>constitutional</i> errors in the English form
of government is at this time highly necessary; for as we are never
in a proper condition of doing justice to others, while we continue under
the influence of some leading partiality, so neither are we capable of
doing it to ourselves while we remain fettered by any obstinate prejudice.
And as a man.  who is attached to a prostitute, is unfitted to choose
or judge a wife, so any prepossession in favour of a rotten constitution
of government will disable us from discerning a good one.</p>

<p><i>of</i> monarchy and hereditary succession</p>

<p>Mankind being originally equals in the order of creation, the equality
could only be destroyed by some subsequent circumstance; the distinctions
of rich, and poor, may in a great measure be accounted for, and that without
having recourse to the harsh, ill-sounding names of oppression and avarice.
Oppression is often the <i>consequence</i>, but seldom or never the means of riches;
and though avarice will preserve a man from being necessitously poor,
it generally makes him too timorous to be wealthy.</p>

<p>But there is another and greater distinction, for which no truly natural
or religious reason can be assigned, and that is, the distinction of men
into <i>kings</i> and subjects.  Male and female are the distinctions of nature,
good and bad the distinctions of heaven; but how a race of men came into
the world so exalted above the rest, and distinguished like some new species,
is worth inquiring into, and whether they are the means of happiness
or of misery to mankind.</p>

<p>In the early ages of the world, according to the scripture chronology,
there were no kings; the consequence of which was, there were no wars;
it is the pride of kings which throw mankind into confusion.  Holland
without a king hath enjoyed more peace for this last century than any
of the  monarchial governments in Europe.  Antiquity favours the same
remark; for the quiet and rural lives of the first patriarchs hath
a happy something in them, which vanishes away when we come to the
history of Jewish royalty.</p>

<p>Government by kings was first introduced into the world by the
Heathens, from whom the children of Israel copied the custom.
It was the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot
for the promotion of idolatry.  The Heathens paid divine honours
to their deceased kings, and the Christian world hath improved
on the plan, by doing the same to their living ones.  How impious
is the title of sacred majesty applied to a worm, who in the midst
of his splendor is crumbling into dust!</p>

<p>As the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be justified
on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be defended on the
authority of scripture; for the will of the Almighty, as declared
by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly disapproves of government
by kings.  All anti-monarchical parts of scripture have been very smoothly
glossed over in monarchical governments, but they undoubtedly merit the
attention of countries which have their governments yet to form.
<i>render</i> unto caesar the things which are caesar'S is the scripture
doctrine of courts, yet it is no support of monarchical government,
for the Jews at that time were without a king, and in a state of vassalage
to the Romans.</p>

<p>Now three thousand years passed away from the Mosaic account of the
creation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a king.
Till then their form of government (except in extraordinary cases,
where the Almighty interposed) was a kind of republic administered
by a judge and the elders of the tribes.  Kings they had none,
and it was held sinful to acknowledge any being under that title
but the Lord of Hosts.  And when a man seriously reflects on the idolatrous
homage which is paid to the persons of kings, he need not wonder that
the Almighty, ever jealous of his honour, should disapprove of a form
of government which so impiously invades the prerogative of heaven.</p>

<p>Monarchy is ranked in scripture as one of the sins of the Jews,
for which a curse in reserve is denounced against them.
The history of that transaction is worth attending to.</p>

<p>The children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon
marched against them with a small army, and victory, through the
divine interposition, decided in his favour.  The Jews, elate with
success, and attributing it to the generalship of Gideon,
proposed making him a king, saying, <i>rule</i> thou over us, thou and thy
<i>son</i> and thy son'S son.  Here was temptation in its fullest extent;
not a kingdom only, but an hereditary one, but Gideon
in the piety of his soul replied, I <i>will</i> not rule over you,
<i>neither</i> shall my son rule over you _the lord shall rule over you._
Words need not be more explicit; Gideon doth not decline the honour,
but denieth their right to give it; neither doth he compliment them
with invented declarations of his thanks, but in the positive style
of a prophet charges them with disaffection to their proper Sovereign,
the King of heaven.</p>

<p>About one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into
the same error.  The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous
customs of the Heathens, is something exceedingly unaccountable; but
so it was, that laying hold of the misconduct of Samuel's two sons,
who were entrusted with some secular concerns, they came in an abrupt
and clamorous manner to Samuel, saying, <i>behold</i> thou art old, and thy
<i>sons</i> walk not in thy ways, now make us A king to judge us, like all
<i>other</i> nations.  And here we cannot but observe that their motives
were bad, viz.  that they might be <i>like</i> unto other nations, i.e.  the
Heathens, whereas their true glory laid in being as much <i>unlike</i> them
as possible.  <i>but</i> the thing displeased samuel when they said, give us
A <i>king</i> to judge us; and samuel prayed unto the lord, and the lord
<i>said</i> unto samuel, hearken unto the voice of the people in all that
<i>they</i> say unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have
<i>rejected</i> me, _that I should not reign over them._  according to
<i>all</i> the works which they have since the day that I brought them
<i>up</i> out of egypt, even unto this day; wherewith they have forsaken me
<i>and</i> served other gods; so do they also unto thee.  now therefore hearken
<i>unto</i> their voice, howbeit, protest solemnly unto them and shew them
<i>the</i> manner of the king that shall reign over them, I.E.  not of any
particular king, but the general manner of the kings of the earth,
whom Israel was so eagerly copying after.  And notwithstanding the
great distance of time and difference of manners, the character is
still in fashion.  <i>and</i> samuel told all the words of the lord unto
<i>the</i> people, that asked of him A king.  and he said, this shall be
<i>the</i> manner of the king that shall reign over you; he will take your
<i>sons</i> and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his
<i>horseman</i>, and some shall run before his chariots (this description
agrees with the present mode of impressing men) <i>and</i> he will appoint
<i>him</i> captains over thousands and captains over fifties, and will set them
<i>to</i> ear his ground and reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war,
<i>and</i> instruments of his chariots; and he will take your daughters
<i>to</i> be confectionaries, and to be cooks and to be bakers
(this describes the expense and luxury as well as the oppression
of kings) <i>and</i> he will take your fields and your olive yards,
<i>even</i> the best of them, and give them to his servants;
<i>and</i> he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
<i>and</i> give them to his officers and to his servants
(by which we see that bribery, corruption, and favouritism
are the standing vices of kings) <i>and</i> he will take the tenth
<i>of</i> your men servants, and your maid servants, and your
<i>goodliest</i> young men and your asses, and put them to his work;
<i>and</i> he will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall be his servants,
<i>and</i> ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have
<i>chosen</i>, _and the lord will not hear you in that day._
This accounts for the continuation of monarchy;
neither do the characters of the few good kings which have lived since,
either sanctify the title, or blot out the sinfulness of the origin;
the high encomium given of David takes no notice of him
<i>officially</i> as A king, but only as a man after God's own heart.
<i>nevertheless</i> the people refused to obey the voice of samuel,
<i>and</i> they said, nay, but we will have A king over us,
<i>that</i> we may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us,
<i>and</i> go out before us, and fight our battles.
Samuel continued to reason with them, but to no purpose; he set before
them their ingratitude, but all would not avail; and seeing them fully
bent on their folly, he cried out, I <i>will</i> call unto the lord,
<i>and</i> he shall send thunder and rain (which then was a punishment,
being in the time of wheat harvest) <i>that</i> ye may perceive and see
<i>that</i> your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord,
<i>and</i> the lord sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people greatly
<i>feared</i> the lord and samuel.  and all the people said unto samuel,
<i>pray</i> for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not,
<i>for</i> _we have added unto our sins this evil, to ask A king._
These portions of scripture are direct and positive.
They admit of no equivocal construction.  That the Almighty
hath here entered his protest against monarchical government,
is true, or the scripture is false.  And a man hath good reason
to believe that there is as much of kingcraft, as priestcraft,
in withholding the scripture from the public in Popish countries.
For monarchy in every instance is the Popery of government.</p>

<p>To the evil of monarchy we have added that of hereditary succession;
and as the first is a degradation and lessening of ourselves,
so the second, claimed as a matter of right, is an insult
and an imposition on posterity.  For all men being originally equals,
no <i>one</i> by birth could have a right to set up his own family in perpetual
preference to all others for ever, and though himself might deserve <i>some</i>
decent degree of honours of his contemporaries, yet his descendants might
be far too unworthy to inherit them.  One of the strongest <i>natural</i> proofs
of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it,
otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by
giving mankind an <i>ass</i> for A lion.</p>

<p>Secondly, as no man at first could possess any other public honours
than were bestowed upon him, so the givers of those honours could have
no power to give away the right of posterity.  And though they might
say, "We chooses you for <i>our</i> head," they could not, without manifest
injustice to their children, say, "that your children and your
children's children shall reign over <i>ours</i> for ever."  Because such
an unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next
succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.
Most wise men, in their private sentiments, have ever treated
hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils,
which when once established is not easily removed;
many submit from fear, others from superstition,
and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.</p>

<p>This is supposing the present race of kings in the world to have had an
honourable origin; whereas it is more than probable, that could we take
off the dark covering of antiquities, and trace them to their first rise,
that we should find the first of them nothing better than the
principal ruffian of some restless gang, whose savage manners
or preeminence in subtlety obtained the title of chief among plunderers;
and who by increasing in power, and extending his depredations,
overawed the quiet and defenseless to purchase their safety
by frequent contributions.  Yet his electors could have no idea
of giving hereditary right to his descendants, because such a perpetual
exclusion of themselves was incompatible with the free and unrestrained
principles they professed to live by.  Wherefore, hereditary succession
in the early ages of monarchy could not take place as a matter of claim,
but as something casual or complemental; but as few or no records were
extant in those days,  and traditional history stuffed with fables,
it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some
superstitious tale, conveniently timed, Mahomet like, to cram hereditary
right down the throats of the vulgar.  Perhaps the disorders which threatened,
or seemed to threaten, on the decease of a leader and the choice of a new one
(for elections among ruffians could not be very orderly) induced many
at first to favour hereditary pretensions; by which means it happened, as it
hath happened since, that what at first was submitted to as a convenience,
was afterwards claimed as a right.</p>

<p>England, since the conquest, hath known some few good monarchs,
but groaned beneath a much larger number of bad ones; yet no man in his
senses can say that their claim under William the Conqueror is a very
honourable one.  A French bastard landing with an armed banditti, and
establishing himself king of England against the consent of the natives,
is in plain terms a very paltry rascally original.  It certainly hath no
divinity in it.  However, it is needless to spend much time in exposing
the folly of hereditary right; if there are any so weak as to believe it,
let them promiscuously worship the ass and lion, and welcome.
I shall neither copy their humility, nor disturb their devotion.</p>

<p>Yet I should be glad to ask how they suppose kings came at first?  The
question admits but of three answers, viz.  either by lot, by election,
or by usurpation.  If the first king was taken by lot, it establishes a
precedent for the next, which excludes hereditary succession.  Saul was
by lot, yet the succession was not hereditary, neither does it appear
from that transaction there was any intention it ever should be.  If the
first king of any country was by election, that likewise establishes a
precedent for the next; for to say, that the <i>right</i> of all future
generations is taken away, by the act of the first electors,
in their choice not only of a king, but of a family of kings for ever,
hath no parallel in or out of scripture but the doctrine of original sin,
which supposes the free will of all men lost in Adam;
and from such comparison, and it will admit of no other,
hereditary succession can derive no glory.  For as in Adam all sinned,
and as in the first electors all men obeyed; as in the one all mankind
we re subjected to Satan, and in the other to Sovereignty; as our innocence
was lost in the first, and our authority in the last; and as both disable
us from reassuming some former state and privilege, it unanswerably
follows that original sin and hereditary succession are parallels.
Dishonourable rank! Inglorious connection!  Yet the most subtle sophist
cannot produce a juster simile.</p>

<p>As to usurpation, no man will be so hardy as to defend it; and that
William the Conqueror was an usurper is a fact not to be contradicted.
The plain truth is, that the antiquity of English monarchy will not
bear looking into.</p>

<p>But it is not so much the absurdity as the evil of hereditary succession
which concerns mankind.  Did it ensure a race of good and wise men
it would have the seal of divine authority, but as it opens a door
to the <i>foolish</i>, the wicked, and the improper, it hath in it the nature
of oppression.  Men who look upon themselves born to reign,
and others to obey, soon grow insolent; selected from the rest
of mankind their minds are early poisoned by importance;
and the world they act in differs so materially from the world at large,
that they have but little opportunity of knowing its true interests,
and when they succeed to the government are frequently the most ignorant
and unfit of any throughout the dominions.</p>

<p>Another evil which attends hereditary succession is, that the throne
is subject to be possessed by a minor at any age; all which time
the regency, acting under the cover a king, have every opportunity
and inducement to betray their trust.  The same national misfortune happens,
when a king, worn out with age and infirmity , enters the last stage
of human weakness.  In both these cases the public becomes a prey
to every miscreant, who can tamper successfully with the follies
either of age or infancy.</p>

<p>The most plausible plea, which hath ever been offered in favour of
hereditary succession, is, that it preserves a nation from civil wars;
and were this true, it would be weighty; whereas, it is the most
barefaced falsity ever imposed upon mankind.  The whole history of
England disowns the fact.  Thirty kings and two minors have reigned
in that distracted kingdom since the conquest, in which time there
have been (including the Revolution) no less than eight civil wars
and nineteen rebellions.  Wherefore instead of making for peace, it
makes against it, and destroys the very foundation it seems to stand on.</p>

<p>The contest for monarchy and succession, between the houses of York
and Lancaster, laid England in a scene of blood for many years.
Twelve pitched battles, besides skirmishes and sieges, were fought between
Henry and Edward.  Twice was Henry prisoner to Edward, who in his turn
was prisoner to Henry.  And so uncertain is the fate of war and the
temper of a nation, when nothing but personal matters are the ground
of a quarrel, that Henry was taken in triumph from a prison to a palace,
and Edward obliged to fly from a palace to a foreign land; yet,
as sudden transitions of temper are seldom lasting, Henry in his turn
was driven from the throne, and Edward recalled to succeed him.
The parliament always following the strongest side.</p>

<p>This contest began in the reign of Henry the Sixth, and was not entirely
extinguished till Henry the Seventh, in whom the families were united.
Including a period of 67 years, viz.  from 1422 to 1489.</p>

<p>In short, monarchy and succession have laid (not this or that kingdom only)
but the world in blood and ashes.  Tis a form of government which the word
of God bears testimony against, and blood will attend it.</p>

<p>If we inquire into the business of a king, we shall find that in some
countries they have none; and after sauntering away their lives
without pleasure to themselves or advantage to the nation,
withdraw from the scene, and leave their successors to tread
the same idle ground.  In absolute monarchies the whole weight of business,
civil and military, lies on the king; the children of Israel in their
request for a king, urged this plea "that he may judge us, and go out
before us and fight our battles."  But in countries where he is neither
a judge nor a general, as in England, a man would be puzzled to know
what <i>is</i> his business.</p>

<p>The nearer any government approaches to a republic the less business
there is for a king.  It is somewhat difficult to find a proper name
for the government of England.  Sir William Meredith calls it a republic;
but in its present state it is unworthy of the name, because the corrupt
influence of the crown, by having all the places in its disposal,
hath so effectually swallowed up the power, and eaten out the virtue
of the house of commons (the republican part in the constitution)
that the government of England is nearly as monarchical as that of France
or Spain.  Men fall out with names without understanding them.
For it is the republican and not the monarchical part of the constitution
of England which Englishmen glory in, viz.  the liberty of choosing an house
of commons from out of their own body - and it is easy to see that when
republican virtue fails, slavery ensues.  Why is the constitution
of England sickly, but because monarchy hath poisoned the republic,
the crown hath engrossed the commons?</p>

<p>In England a king hath little more to do than to make war
and give away places; which in plain terms, is to impoverish
the nation and set it together by the ears.  A pretty business indeed
for a man to be allowed eight hundred thousand sterling a year for,
and worshipped into the bargain!  Of more worth is one honest man
to society and in the sight of God, than all the crowned ruffians
that ever lived.</p>

<p><i>thoughts</i> on the present state of american affairs</p>


<p>In the following pages I offer nothing more than simple facts,
plain arguments, and common sense; and have no other Preliminaries
to settle with the reader, than that he will divest himself of prejudice
and prepossession, and suffer his reason and his feelings to determine
for themselves; that he will put <i>on</i>, or rather that he will not put off
the true character of a man, and generously enlarge his views beyond
the present day.</p>

<p>Volumes have been written on the subject of the struggle between
England and America.  Men of all ranks have embarked in the controversy,
from different motives, and with various designs; but all have been
ineffectual, and the period of debate is closed.  Arms, as the last
resource, decide this contest; the appeal was the choice of the king,
and the continent hath accepted the challenge.</p>

<p>It hath been reported of the late Mr. Pelham (who tho' an
able minister was not without his faults) that on his being
attacked in the house of commons, on the score, that his measures
were only of a temporary kind, replied "<i>they</i> will last my time."
Should a thought so fatal and unmanly possess the colonies
in the present contest, the name of ancestors will be remembered
by future generations with detestation.</p>

<p>The sun never shined on a cause of greater worth.  'Tis not
the affair of a city, a county, a province, or a kingdom, but of
a continent - of at least one eighth part of the habitable globe.
'Tis not the concern of a day, a year, or an age; posterity are
virtually involved in the contest, and will be more or less
affected, even to the end of time, by the proceedings now.
Now is the seed-time of continental union, faith and honour.
The least fracture now will be like a name engraved with the point
of a pin on the tender rind of a young oak; the wound will enlarge
with the tree, and posterity read it in full grown characters.</p>

<p>By referring the matter from argument to arms, a new aera
for politics is struck; a new method of thinking hath arisen.
All plans, proposals, &c.  prior to the nineteenth of April,
i.  e.  to the commencement of hostilities, are like the almanacs
of the last year; which, though proper then are superseded
and useless now.  Whatever was advanced by the advocates on
either side of the question then, terminated in one and the
same point.  viz.  a union with Great-Britain: the only difference
between the parties was the method of effecting it; the one
proposing force, the other friendship; but it hath so far
happened that the first hath failed, and the second hath
withdrawn her influence.</p>

<p>As much hath been said of the advantages of reconciliation which,
like an agreeable dream, hath passed away and left us as we were,
it is but right, that we should examine the contrary side
of the argument, and inquire into some of the many material injuries
which these colonies sustain, and always will sustain,
by being connected with, and dependent on Great Britain:
To examine that connection and dependence, on the principles
of nature and common sense, to see what we have to trust to,
if separated, and what we are to expect, if dependant.</p>

<p>I have heard it asserted by some, that as America hath
flourished under her former connection with Great Britain
that the same connection is necessary towards her future
happiness, and will always have the same effect.
Nothing can be more fallacious than this kind of argument.
We may as well assert that because a child has thrived upon milk
that it is never to have meat, or that the first twenty years
of our lives is to become a precedent for the next twenty.
But even this is admitting more than is true, for I answer roundly,
that America would have flourished as much, and probably much more,
had no European power had any thing to do with her.  The commerce,
by which she hath enriched herself, are the necessaries of life,
and will always have a market while eating is the custom of Europe.</p>

<p>But she has protected us, say some.  That she has engrossed
us is true, and defended the continent at our expense as well
as her own is admitted, and she would have defended Turkey
from the same motive, viz.  the sake of trade and dominion.</p>

<p>Alas, we have been long led away by ancient prejudices,
and made large sacrifices to superstition.  We have boasted
the protection of Great Britain, without considering,
that her motive was <i>interest</i> not attachment; that she
did not protect us from <i>our</i> enemies on our account,
but from <i>her</i> enemies on her own account, from those
who had no quarrel with us on any <i>other</i> account,
and who will always be our enemies on the <i>same</i> account.
Let Britain wave her pretensions to the continent,
or the continent throw off the dependence, and we should
be at peace with France and Spain were they at war with Britain.
The miseries of Hanover last war ought to warn us against connections.</p>

<p>It has lately been asserted in parliament, that the colonies
have no relation to each other but through the parent country,
i.  e.  that Pennsylvania and the Jerseys, and so on for the rest,
are sister colonies by the way of England; this is certainly
a very round-about way of proving relationship, but it is the
nearest and only true way of proving enemyship, if I may so call it.
France and Spain never were.  nor perhaps ever will be our enemies
as <i>americans</i>, but as our being the subjects of great britain.</p>

<p>But Britain is the parent country, say some.  Then the more shame
upon her conduct.  Even brutes do not devour their young,
nor savages make war upon their families; wherefore the assertion,
if true, turns to her reproach; but it happens not to be true,
or only partly so and the phrase <i>parent</i> or mother country
hath been jesuitically adopted by the king and his parasites,
with a low papistical design of gaining an unfair bias
on the credulous weakness of our minds.  Europe, and not England,
is the parent country of America.  This new world hath been the asylum
for the persecuted lovers of civil and religious liberty from <i>every</i> part
of Europe.  Hither have they fled, not from the tender embraces of the mother, but
from the cruelty of the monster; and it is so far true of England,
that the same tyranny which drove the first emigrants from home,
pursues their descendants still.</p>

<p>In this extensive quarter of the globe, we forget the narrow limits
of three hundred and sixty miles (the extent of England)
and carry our friendship on a larger scale; we claim brotherhood
with every European Christian, and triumph in the generosity of the sentiment.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to observe by what regular gradations
we surmount the force of local prejudice, as we enlarge
our acquaintance with the world.  A man born in any town
in England divided into parishes, will naturally associate most
with his fellow-parishioners (because their interests in many
cases will be common) and distinguish him by the name of <i>neighbour</i>;
if he meet him but a few miles from home, he drops the narrow idea
of a street, and salutes him by the name of <i>townsman</i>; if he travel out
of the county, and meet him in any other, he forgets the minor divisions
of street and town, and calls him <i>countryman</i>, i.  e.  countryman;
but if in their foreign excursions they should associate in France
or any other part of <i>europe</i>, their local remembrance would be enlarged
into that of <i>englishmen</i>.  And by a just parity of reasoning,
all Europeans meeting in America, or any other quarter of the globe,
are <i>countrymen</i>; for England, Holland, Germany, or Sweden, when compared
with the whole, stand in the same places on the larger scale,
which the divisions of street, town, and county do on the smaller ones;
distinctions too limited for continental minds.  Not one third of
the inhabitants, even of this province, are of English descent.
Wherefore I reprobate the phrase of parent or mother country applied
to England only, as being false, selfish, narrow and ungenerous.</p>

<p>But admitting, that we were all of English descent, what does
it amount to?  Nothing.  Britain, being now an open enemy,
extinguishes every other name and title:  And to say that
reconciliation is our duty, is truly farcical.  The first
king of England, of the present line (William the Conqueror)
was a Frenchman, and half the Peers of England are descendants
from the same country; therefore, by the same method of reasoning,
England ought to be governed by France.</p>

<p>Much hath been said of the united strength of Britain and the colonies,
that in conjunction they might bid defiance to the world.  But this
is mere presumption; the fate of war is uncertain, neither do
the expressions mean any thing; for this continent would never suffer
itself to be drained of inhabitants, to support the British arms
in either Asia, Africa, or Europe.</p>

<p>Besides what have we to do with setting the world at defiance?
Our plan is commerce, and that, well attended to, will secure us
the peace and friendship of all Europe; because, it is the
interest of all Europe to have America a <i>free</i> port.  Her trade
will always be a protection, and her barrenness of gold and silver
secure her from invaders.</p>

<p>I challenge the warmest advocate for reconciliation, to shew,
a single advantage that this continent can reap, by being connected
with Great Britain.  I repeat the challenge, not a single advantage
is derived.  Our corn will fetch its price in any market in Europe,
and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we will.</p>

<p>But the injuries and disadvantages we sustain by that connection,
are without number; and our duty to mankind at large,
as well as to ourselves, instruct us to renounce the alliance:
Because, any submission to, or dependence on Great Britain,
tends directly to involve this continent in European wars and quarrels;
and sets us at variance with nations, who would otherwise seek our friendship,
and against whom, we have neither anger nor complaint.  As Europe is our market
for trade, we ought to form no partial connection with any part of it.
It is the true interest of America to steer clear of European contentions,
which she never can do, while by her dependence on Britain,
she is made the make-weight in the scale of British politics.</p>

<p>Europe is too thickly planted with kingdoms to be long at peace,
and whenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power,
the trade of America goes to ruin, <i>because</i> of her connection with england.
The next war may not turn out like the last, and should it not,
the advocates for reconciliation now, will be wishing for separation then,
because, neutrality in that case, would be a safer convoy than a man of war.
Every thing that is right or natural pleads for separation.  The blood
of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, '<i>tis</i> time to part.
Even the distance at which the Almighty hath placed England and America,
is a strong and natural proof, that the authority of the one, over the other,
was never the design of Heaven.  The time likewise at which the continent
was discovered, adds weight to the argument, and the manner in which it
was peopled increases the force of it.  The reformation was preceded
by the discovery of America, as if the Almighty graciously meant
to open a sanctuary to the Persecuted in future years,
when home should afford neither friendship nor safety.</p>

<p>The authority of Great Britain over this continent,
is a form of government, which sooner or later must have an end:
And a serious mind can draw no true pleasure by looking forward
under the painful and positive conviction, that what he calls
"the present constitution" is merely temporary.  As parents,
we can have no joy, knowing that <i>this</i> government is not sufficiently
lasting to ensure any thing which we may bequeath to posterity:
And by a plain method of argument, as we are running the next generation
into debt, we ought to do the work of it, otherwise we use them meanly
and pitifully.  In order to discover the line of our duty rightly,
we should take our children in our hand, and fix our station a few years
farther into life; that eminence will present a prospect, which a few
present fears and prejudices conceal from our sight.</p>

<p>Though I would carefully avoid giving unnecessary offense,
yet I am inclined to believe, that all those who espouse the doctrine
of reconciliation, may be included within the following descriptions.
Interested men, who are not to be trusted; weak men, who <i>cannot</i> see;
prejudiced men, who <i>will</i> not see; and a certain set of moderate men,
who think better of the European world than it deserves;
and this last class, by an ill-judged deliberation, will be
the cause of more calamities to this continent, than all the other three.</p>

<p>It is the good fortune of many to live distant from the scene of sorrow;
the evil is not sufficient brought to their doors to make <i>them</i>
feel the precariousness with which all American property is possessed.
But let our imaginations transport us far a few moments to Boston,
that seat of wretchedness will teach us wisdom, and instruct us
for ever to renounce a power in whom we can have no trust.
The inhabitants of that unfortunate city, who but a few months ago
were in ease and affluence, have now, no other alternative than
to stay and starve, or turn and beg.  Endangered by the fire
of their friends if they continue within the city, and plundered
by the soldiery if they leave it.  In their present condition
they are prisoners without the hope of redemption, and in
a general attack for their relief, they would be exposed
to the fury of both armies.</p>

<p>Men of passive tempers look somewhat lightly over the offenses
of Britain, and, still hoping for the best, are apt to call out,
"<i>come</i>, come, we shall be friends again, for all this."
But examine the passions and feelings of mankind,
Bring the doctrine of reconciliation to the touchstone of nature,
and then tell me, whether you can hereafter love, honor,
and faithfully serve the power that hath carried
fire and sword into your land?  If yon cannot do all these,
then are you only deceiving yourselves, and by your delay
bringing ruin upon posterity.  Your future connection with Britain,
whom you can neither love nor honor will be forced and unnatural,
and being formed only on the plan of present convenience,
will in a little time fall into a relapse more wretched than the first.
But if you say, you can still pass the violations over, then I ask,
Hath your house been burnt? Hath your property been destroyed before
your face! Are your wife and children destitute of a bed to lie on,
or bread to live on? Have you lost a parent or a child by their hands,
and yourself the ruined and wretched survivor!  If you have not,
then are you not a judge of those who have.  But if you have,
and still can shake hands with the murderers, then are you unworthy
the name of husband, father, friend, or lover, and whatever
may be your rank or title in life, you have the heart of a coward,
and the spirit of a sycophant.</p>

<p>This is not inflaming or exaggerating matters, but trying
them by those feelings and affections which nature justifies,
and without which, we should be incapable of discharging
the social duties of life, or enjoying the felicities of it.
I mean not to exhibit horror for the purpose of provoking revenge,
but to awaken us from fatal and unmanly slumbers, that we
may pursue determinately some fixed object.  It is not in the
power of Britain or of Europe to conquer America, if she do
not conquer herself by <i>delay</i> and timidity.  The present winter
is worth an age if rightly employed, but if lost or neglected,
the whole continent will partake of the misfortune;
and there is no punishment which that man will not deserve,
be he who, or what, or where he will, that may be the means
of sacrificing a season so precious and useful.</p>

<p>It is repugnant to reason, to the universal order of things,
to all examples from former ages, to suppose, that this
continent can longer remain subject to any external power.
The most sanguine in Britain does not think so.  The utmost
stretch of human wisdom cannot, at this time, compass a plan
short of separation, which can promise the continent even
a year's security.  Reconciliation is <i>now</i> a fallacious dream.
Nature hath deserted the connection, and Art cannot supply
her place.  For, as Milton wisely expresses, "never can true
reconcilement grow, where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep."</p>

<p>Every quiet method for peace hath been ineffectual.  Our prayers
have been rejected with disdain; and only tended to convince us,
that nothing Batters vanity, or confirms obstinacy in Kings
more than repeated petitioning-and nothing hath contributed
more than that very measure to make the Kings of Europe absolute:
Witness Denmark and Sweden.  Wherefore, since nothing but blows will do,
for God's sake, let us come to a final separation, and not leave
the next generation to be cutting throats, under the violated
unmeaning names of parent and child.</p>

<p>To say, they will never attempt it again is idle and visionary,
we thought so at the repeal of the stamp-act, yet a year
or two undeceived us; as well may we suppose that nations,
which have been once defeated, will never renew the quarrel.</p>

<p>As to government matters, it is not in the power of Britain
to do this continent justice:  The business of it will soon
be too weighty, and intricate, to be managed with any tolerable
degree of convenience, by a power so distant from us, and so
very ignorant of us; for if they cannot conquer us, they cannot
govern us.  To be always running three or four thousand miles
with a tale or a petition, waiting four or five months
for an answer, which when obtained requires five or six more
to explain it in, will in a few years be looked upon as folly
and childishness- - -There was a time when it was proper,
and there is a proper time for it to cease.</p>

<p>Small islands not capable of protecting themselves,
are the proper objects for kingdoms to take under their care;
but there is something very absurd, in supposing a continent
to be perpetually governed by an island.  In no instance hath
nature made the satellite larger than its primary planet,
and as England and America, with respect to each other,
reverses the common order of nature, it is evident they belong
to different systems; England to Europe, America to itself.</p>

<p>I am not induced by motives of pride, party, or resentment
to espouse the doctrine of separation and independance;
I am clearly, positively, and conscientiously persuaded
that it is the true interest of this continent to be so;
that every thing short of <i>that</i> is mere patchwork,
that it can afford no lasting felicity,
- - -that it is leaving the sword to our children,
and shrinking back at a time, when, a little more,
a little farther, would have rendered this continent
the glory of the earth.</p>

<p>As Britain hath not manifested the least inclination towards
a compromise, we may be assured that no terms can be obtained
worthy the acceptance of the continent, or any ways equal
to the expense of blood and treasure we have been already put to.</p>

<p>The object, contended for, ought always to bear some just proportion
to the expense.  The removal of North, or the whole detestable junto,
is a matter unworthy the millions we have expended.  A temporary stoppage
of trade, was an inconvenience, which would have sufficiently balanced
the repeal of all the acts complained of, had such repeals been obtained;
hut if the whole continent must take up arms, if every man must be a soldier,
it is scarcely worth our while to fight against a contemptible ministry only.
Dearly, dearly, do we pay for the repeal of the acts, if that is all
we fight for; for in a just estimation, it is as great a folly to pay
a Bunker-hill price for law, as for land.  As I have always considered
the independancy of this continent, as an event, which sooner or later
must arrive, so from the late rapid progress of the continent to maturity,
the event could not be far off.  Wherefore, on the breaking out of hostilities,
it was not worth while to have disputed a matter, which time would have
finally redressed, unless we meant to be in earnest; otherwise, it is like
wasting an estate on a suit at law, to regulate the trespasses of a tenant,
whose lease is just expiring.  No man was a warmer wisher for reconciliation
than myself, before the fatal nineteenth of April 1775, but the moment
the event of that day was made known, I rejected the hardened,
sullen tempered Pharaoh of England for ever; and disdain the wretch,
that with the pretended title of <i>father</i> of his people can unfeelingly hear
of their slaughter, and composedly sleep with their blood upon his soul.</p>

<p>But admitting that matters were now made up, what would be the event?
I answer, the ruin of the continent.  And that for several reasons.</p>

<p><i>first</i>.  The powers of governing still remaining in the hands
of the king, he will have a negative over the whole legislation
of this continent.  And as he hath shewn himself such an
inveterate enemy to liberty.  and discovered such a thirst
for arbitrary power; is he, or is he not, a proper man to say to
these colonies, "<i>you</i> shall make no laws but what I please.'
And is there any inhabitant in America so ignorant as not to know,
that according to what is called the <i>present</i> constitution,
that this continent can make no laws but what the king gives leave to;
and is there any man so unwise, as not to see, that (considering what
has happened) he will suffer no law to be made here, but such as suit
<i>his</i> purpose.  We may be as effectually enslaved by the want
of laws in America, as by submitting to laws made for us in England.
After matters are made up (as it is called) can there be any doubt,
but the whole power of the crown will be exerted, to keep this continent
as low and humble as possible?  Instead of going forward we shall
go backward, or be perpetually quarrelling or ridiculously petitioning.
- - -<i>we</i> are already greater than the king wishes us to be, and will he not
hereafter endeavour to make us less?  To bring the matter to one point.
Is the power who is jealous of our prosperity, a proper power to govern us?
Whoever says No to this question, is an <i>independant</i>, for independancy
means no more, than, whether we shall make our own laws,
or whether the king, the greatest enemy this continent hath,
or can have, shall tell us "<i>there</i> shall be no laws but such as I like."</p>

<p>But the king you will say has a negative in England; the people there
can make no laws without his consent.  In point of right and good order,
there is something very ridiculous, that a youth of twenty-one
(which hath often happened) shall say to several millions of people,
older and wiser than himself, I forbid this or that act of yours to be law.
But in this place I decline this sort of reply, though I will never cease
to expose the absurdity of it, and only answer, that England being the King's
residence, and America not so, makes quite another case.  The king's negative
<i>here</i> is ten times more dangerous and fatal than it can be in England,
for <i>there</i> he will scarcely refuse his consent to a bill for putting England
into as strong a state of defense as possible, and in America he would never
suffer such a bill to be passed.</p>

<p>America is only a secondary object in the system of British politics,
England consults the good of <i>this</i> country, no farther than it answers
her <i>own</i> purpose.  Wherefore, her own interest leads her to suppress
the growth of <i>ours</i> in every case which doth not promote her advantage,
or in the least interferes with it.  A pretty state we should soon be in
under such a secondhand government, considering what has happened!
Men do not change from enemies to friends by the alteration of a name:
And in order to shew that reconciliation now is a dangerous doctrine,
I affirm, <i>that</i> it would be policy in the king at this time, to repeal
<i>the</i> acts for the sake of reinstating himself in the government
<i>of</i> the provinces; in order, that he may accomplish by craft and subtlety,
<i>in</i> the long run, what he cannot do by force and violence in the short one.
Reconciliation and ruin are nearly related.</p>

<p><i>secondly</i>.  That as even the best terms, which we can expect to obtain,
can amount to no more than a temporary expedient, or a kind of government
by guardianship, which can last no longer than till the colonies come of age,
so the general face and state of things, in the interim, will be unsettled
and unpromising.  Emigrants of property will not choose to come to a country
whose form of government hangs but by a thread, and who is every day tottering
on the brink of commotion and disturbance; and numbers of the present
inhabitants would lay hold of the interval, to dispense of their effects,
and quit the continent.</p>

<p>But the most powerful of all arguments, is, that nothing but independence,
i.e.  a continental form of government, can keep the peace of the continent
and preserve it inviolate from civil wars.  I dread the event of a
reconciliation with Britain now, as it is more than probable,
that it will be followed by a revolt somewhere or other, the consequences
of which may be far more fatal than all the malice of Britain.</p>

<p>Thousands are already ruined by British barbarity; (thousands more will
probably suffer the same fate) Those men have other feelings than us who
have nothing suffered.  All they <i>now</i> possess is liberty, what they before
enjoyed is sacrificed to its service, and having nothing more to lose,
they disdain submission.  Besides, the general temper of the colonies,
towards a British government, will be like that of a youth,
who is nearly out of his time; they will care very little about her.
And a government which cannot preserve the peace, is no government at all,
and in that case we pay our money for nothing; and pray what is it that
Britain can do, whose power will he wholly on paper.  should a civil
tumult break out the very day after reconciliation!  I have heard
some men say, many of whom I believe spoke without thinking, that they
dreaded an independence, fearing that it would produce civil wars.
It is but seldom that our first thoughts are truly correct, and that
is the case here; for there are ten times more to dread from a patched up
connection than from independence.  I make the sufferers case my own,
and I protest, that were I driven from house and home, my property destroyed,
and my circumstances ruined, that as man, sensible of injuries, I could never
relish the doctrine of reconciliation, or consider myself bound thereby.</p>

<p>The colonies have manifested such a spirit of good order and obedience
to continental government, as is sufficient to make every reasonable
person easy and happy on that head.  No man can assign the least pretence
for his fears, on any other grounds, than such as are truly childish
and ridiculous, viz.  that one colony will be striving for superiority
over another.</p>

<p>Where there are no distinctions there can be no superiority,
perfect equality affords no temptation.  The republics of Europe
are all (and we may say always) in peace.  Holland and Switzerland
are without wars, foreign or domestic:  Monarchical governments,
it is true, are never long at rest; the crown itself is a temptation
to enterprising ruffians at <i>home</i>; and that degree of pride and insolence
ever attendant on regal authority, swells into a rupture with foreign powers,
in instances, where a republican government, by being formed on more
natural principles, would negotiate the mistake.</p>

<p>If there is any true cause of fear respecting independence,
it is because no plan is yet laid down.  Men do not see their way out- - -
Wherefore, as an opening into that business, I offer the following hints;
at the same time modestly affirming, that I have no other opinion
of them myself, than that they may be the means of giving rise to
something better.  Could the straggling thoughts of individuals
be collected, they would frequently form materials for wise
and able men to improve into useful matter.</p>

<p><i>let</i> the assemblies be annual, with a President only.
The representation more equal.  Their business wholly domestic,
and subject to the authority of a Continental Congress.</p>

<p>Let each colony be divided into six, eight, or ten, convenient districts,
each district to send a proper number of delegates to Congress,
so that each colony send at least thirty.  The whole number in Congress
will be at least 390.  Each Congress to sit and to choose a president
by the following method.  When the delegates are met, let a colony be taken
from the whole thirteen colonies by lot, after which, let the whole Congress
choose (by ballot) a president from out of the delegates of that province.
In the next Congress, let a colony be taken by lot from twelve only, omitting
that colony from which the president was taken in the former Congress, and so
proceeding on till the whole thirteen shall have had their proper rotation.
And in order that nothing may pass into a law but what is satisfactorily
just not less than three fifths of the Congress to be called a majority- - -
He that will promote discord, under a government so equally formed as this,
would have joined Lucifer in his revolt.</p>

<p>But as there is a peculiar delicacy, from whom, or in what manner,
this business must first arise, and as it seems most agreeable
and consistent, that it should come from some intermediate body
between the governed and the governors, that is, between the Congress
and the people.  let a <i>continental</i> conference be held, in the following manner,
and for the following purpose.</p>

<p>A committee of twenty-six members of Congress, viz.  two for each colony.
Two Members from each House of Assembly, or Provincial Convention;
and five representatives of the people at large, to be chosen in the capital
city or town of each province, for and in behalf of the whole province,
by as many qualified voters as shall think proper to attend from
all parts of the province for that purpose; or, if more convenient,
the representatives may be chosen in two or three of the most populous
parts thereof.  In this conference, thus assembled, will be united,
the two grand principles of business <i>knowledge</i> and power.  The members
of Congress, Assemblies, or Conventions, by having had experience in
national concerns, will be able and useful counsellors, and the whole,
being empowered by the people, will have a truly legal authority.</p>

<p>The conferring members being met, let their business be to frame
a <i>continental</i> charter, Or Charter of the United Colonies;
(answering to what is called the Magna Carta of England) fixing
the number and manner of choosing members of Congress, members of Assembly,
with their date of sitting, and drawing the line of business and jurisdiction
between them:  (Always remembering, that our strength is continental,
not provincial:)  Securing freedom and property to all men, and above
all things, the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates
of conscience; with such other matter as is necessary for a charter
to contain.  Immediately after which, the said Conference to dissolve,
and the bodies which shall be chosen comformable to the said charter,
to be the legislators and governors of this continent for the time being:
Whose peace and happiness may God preserve, Amen.</p>

<p>Should any body of men be hereafter delegated for this
or some similar purpose, I offer them the following extracts
or that wise observer on governments <i>dragonetti</i>.
"The science" says he "of the politician consists
in fixing the true point of happiness and freedom.
Those men would deserve the gratitude of ages,
who should discover a mode of government that contained
the greatest sum of individual happiness, with the least
national expense.  [Dragonetti on virtue and rewards]</p>

<p>But where, says some, is the King of America? I'll tell you.
Friend, he reigns above, and doth not make havoc of mankind
like the Royal Brute of Britain.  Yet that we may not appear
to be defective even in earthly honors, let a day be solemnly
set apart for proclaiming the charter; let it be brought forth
placed on the divine law, the word of God; let a crown be placed thereon,
by which the world may know, that so far we approve of monarchy,
that in America <i>the</i> law is king.  For as in absolute governments
the King is law, so in free countries the law <i>ought</i> to be King;
and there ought to be no other.  But lest any ill use should
afterwards arise, let the crown at the conclusion of the ceremony,
be demolished, and scattered among the people whose right it is.</p>

<p>A government of our own is our natural right:  And when a man seriously
reacts on the precariousness of human affairs, he will become convinced,
that it is infinitely wiser and safer, to form a constitution
of our own in a cool deliberate manner, while we have it in our power,
than to trust such an interesting event to time and chance.
If we omit it now, some [Thomas Anello otherwise Massanello
a fisherman of Naples, who after spiriting up his countrymen
in the public marketplace, against the oppressions of the Spaniards,
to whom the place was then subject prompted them to revolt,
and in the space of a day became king.]  Massanello may hereafter arise,
who laying hold of popular disquietudes, may collect together the desperate
and the discontented, and by assuming to themselves the powers of government,
may sweep away the liberties of the continent like a deluge.  Should the
government of America return again into the hands of Britain, the tottering
situation of things will be a temptation for some desperate adventurer
to try his fortune; and in such a case, that relief can Britain give?
Ere she could hear the news, the fatal business might be done;
and ourselves suffering like the wretched Britons under
the oppression of the Conqueror.  Ye that oppose independence now,
ye know not what ye do; ye are opening a door to eternal tyranny,
by keeping vacant the seat of government.  There are thousands,
and tens of thousands, who would think it glorious
to expel from the continent that barbarous and hellish power,
which hath stirred up the Indians and Negroes to destroy us;
the cruelty hath a double guilt, it is dealing brutally by us,
and treacherously by them.</p>

<p>To talk of friendship with those in whom our reason forbids us
to have faith, and our affections wounded through a thousand pores
instruct us to detest, is madness and folly.  Every day wears out
the little remains of kindred between us and them, and can there
be any reason to hope, that as the relationship expires,
the affection will increase, or that we shall agree better,
when we have ten times more and greater concerns to quarrel over than ever?</p>

<p>Ye that tell us of harmony and reconciliation, can ye restore to us the
time that is past?  Can ye give to prostitution its former innocence?
Neither can ye reconcile Britain and America.  The last cord
now is broken, the people of England are presenting addresses against us.
There are injuries which nature cannot forgive; she would cease to be nature
if she did.  As well can the lover forgive the ravisher of his mistress,
as the continent forgive the murders of Britain.  The Almighty hath
implanted in us these unextinguishable feelings for good and wise purposes.
They are the guardians of his image in our hearts.  They distinguish us
from the herd of common animals.  The social compact would dissolve,
and justice be extirpated the earth, or have only a casual existence
were we callous to the touches of affection.  The robber, and the murderer,
would often escape unpunished, did not the injuries which our tempers sustain,
provoke us into justice.</p>

<p>O ye that love mankind!  Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny,
but the tyrant, stand forth!  Every spot of the old world is overrun with
oppression.  Freedom hath been hunted round the globe.  Asia, and Africa,
have long expelled her- - -Europe regards her like a stranger, and England
hath given her warning to depart.  O! receive the fugitive, and prepare
in time an asylum for mankind.</p>

<p><i>of</i> the present _ability_ of _america_, with some miscellaneous _reflections_</p>

<p>I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who hath not
confessed his opinion that a separation between the countries,
would take place one time or other:  And there is no instance, in which we
have shewn less judgement, than in endeavouring to describe, what we call
the ripeness or fitness of the Continent for independence.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Here ends the examination of your testimony; (which I call upon no man
to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;)
to which I subjoin the following remark; "That the setting up and putting
down of kings," most certainly mean, the making him a king, who is yet
not so, and the making him no king who is already one.  And pray what hath
this to do in the present case?  We neither mean to set up nor to pull down,
neither to make nor to unmake, but to have nothing to do with them.
Wherefore, your testimony in whatever light it is viewed serves only
to dishonor your judgement, and for many other reasons had better
have been let alone than published.</p>

<p>First, Because it tends to the decrease and reproach
of all religion whatever, and is of the utmost danger
to society to make it a party in political disputes.</p>

<p>Secondly, Because it exhibits a body of men, numbers of whom disavow
the publishing political testimonies, as being concerned therein
and approvers thereof.</p>

<p>Thirdly, because it hath a tendency to undo that continental harmony
and friendship which yourselves by your late liberal and charitable
donations hath lent a hand to establish; and the preservation of which,
is of the utmost consequence to us all.</p>

<p>And here without anger or resentment I bid you farewell.
Sincerely wishing, that as men and christians, ye may always
fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right;
and be, in your turn, the means of securing it to others;
but that the example which ye have unwisely set,
of mingling religion with politics, <i>may</i> be disavowed
<i>and</i> reprobated by every inhabitant of _america._</p>
