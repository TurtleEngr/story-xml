Getting Serna installed. 32bit version:

If on a 64bit Linux, first get 32bit versions installed:
	Source: http://askubuntu.com/questions/454253/how-to-run-32-bit-app-in-ubuntu-64-bit
	http://www.webcitation.org/6e3AY8Bjp
	sudo -s
	dpkg --add-architecture i386
	echo "foreign-architecture i386" > /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg.d/multiarch
	apt-get update
	apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
	apt-get install libxmu6:i386

cp serna-free-4.2.0-20090714.tgz ~/tmp
cd tmp
sudo -s
tar -xzf serna-free-4.2.0-20090714.tgz
cd serna-4.2
./install.sh
#Install at /opt/serna
	
---------------

* the multi-ch output needs a lot of re-work.

* Move @draft and @debug from def-style to def-content.
  - actually, remove @draft,  Leave @debug, and make it
    toggle message output.

* Remove pre-fmt (only pre is needed) - find out if this is true.
  Found: convert-2to3.xsl:Change: pre elements to pre-fmt in non-thread sections.
  Find out why.

* Get RenderX working better:

	* The Courier font is proportional.  Type in spec file? - done
	* The Copyright page flows into the next pages. - done
	* Images are indented rather than being left justified.
	* Document the changes needed to get fonts embedded.  Setup
	  scripts which can hook up all the configurations needed.

* Fix links in pdf file.  Also, (maybe url shouldn't always be in ().

* img - inline or flow
  html flow: align="left" style="margin: 1em"

* Fix serna display of start/end dates, add def-when

* Get the chapter file output mode working.

* Take time valued from planner, and replace the times in the story

* Clean up the Serna publish targets (pdf, ps, html, docbook, text)

	* Modularize the template file: different story templates, and
	  differenct publish backends

* Get it running with newer Serna versions

* Get this running in editix (i.e. with schema)

* Clean up the docbook print

* Fix up the def-content, def-draft, and def-print so that values can
  be inherited from a previously defined default set.  This can be
  recursive, but not circular.  Of course this could be simulated with
  entities.

* Publish the tool

	* Create a complete sample book, from a non-copyrighted work.

	* Create a book example with this tool, i.e. a user guide,
	  tutorial, developer guide.  Publish on lulu.

	* Put tool in sourceforge? (GNU license?)

	* Submit tool to SynText (Serna)

	* Submit tool to Lulu (show how it can be used with Serna and editix)
	  Show how it can output Docbook

* Add footnote support.

      * html style: end of chapter, or end of book (after epilog)
      * pdf style: end of page, end of chapter, or end of book

* Add "Part I", "Part II", ... or "Book 1", "Book 2", ... headings?
(This can be simulated with a chapter)

* Try to get &#160; working, rather than indent, just in case
browsers don't implement indent.  Actually provide the nbsp and br
tag as a fmt option for browsers that don't use css.
